# dice-game  logic
one player can roll the dice as many time as he want as far as he didn't get one point on the dice. But if he gets one point when he roll the dice he will lose all points he got and the second player will be switched unless he hold the current score before he gets a one point on a dice. The player who get 100 point first will be the winner. The second player will start his turn if the current player hold the score or get one point.
